Hit the “Attack” button repeatedly to maximise your score. <br><br> * When the timer runs out, the game is over. <br><br> * Randomly there will be a "Don't Attack!" message flashing in the center.  Do not attack, you will not get points.  You will also lose health.  If health goes to zero, the game is over. |
